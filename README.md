# MaisonLogicielLibre_FirstGitHubMeetUp
Creating this repository while attending the meetup of 9th March, 2016
While creating this repository, I am attending the presentation at Maison Logiciel Libre at ETS.
As the description suggests, this repository is created as a test repository. The presentation is completely in French :'( My French is as good as my German.. (I only know some basic greetings and cuss words)

The presentation seems to be very detailed! Wish I could comprehend French! aaaaaaaaaa tabarnak!
